## <a name="introduction">🤖 Introduction</a>

Hi, I'm Mohammad Hafeez — a passionate Software Developer with strong skills in JavaScript, and hands-on experience in building modern, responsive web applications using React.js, Node.js, and Express.js. I love turning ideas into real-world, scalable, and user-friendly solutions.

In addition to web development, I’m actively learning C++, Python, and diving deep into Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) to strengthen my problem-solving skills. I’m also exploring the exciting world of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to stay ahead in the evolving tech landscape.

I’m a quick learner, a team player, and someone who thrives in fast-paced environments. My mission is to keep growing as a developer and contribute to meaningful, impactful digital products.
